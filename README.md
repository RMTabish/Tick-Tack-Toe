Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a Python implementation of a dynamic Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on a variable-sized board, and the number of players can be set from 2 to 5. Players take turns placing their marks on the board until one player gets a winning combination or the board is full and the game ends in a tie.

#Getting Started
To play the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

To get a copy of the project, you can clone the repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file from the GitHub page and extract it to a local directory.

#Usage
Once you have the project on your machine, you can start the game by running the tic_tac_toe.py file using the following command:

Copy code
python tic_tac_toe.py
The game will ask you to input the number of players (between 2 and 5) and the board size (between 3 and 10). Once the game is started, each player will take turns placing their marks on the board using the coordinates of their chosen cell. The game will continue until one player gets a winning combination or the board is full and the game ends in a tie.

#Contributing
